# BTCMiner Token Implementation Guide: LayerZero OFT Cross-Chain Architecture

## Project Overview
You are tasked with creating **BTCMiner**, an advanced omnichain fungible token (OFT) leveraging LayerZero's infrastructure to enable seamless cross-chain operations with dynamic burn-to-mint mechanisms for $THS (Terahash) conversion.

## Core Technical Requirements

### 1. LayerZero OFT Implementation

#### Primary Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
// Base contract structure expectations
contract BTCMiner is OFTCore {
    // Implement LayerZero OFT standards
    // Support for multiple chain deployments
    // Cross-chain message passing capabilities
}
```

**Key Implementation Requirements:**
- Deploy BTCMiner as a LayerZero OFT on **minimum 5 chains**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and BNB Chain
- Implement `_lzSend()` and `_lzReceive()` functions for cross-chain communication
- Configure proper endpoint addresses for each supported chain
- Implement gas estimation mechanisms for cross-chain transfers
- Set up trusted remote configurations between all chain pairs

#### Chain-Specific Configurations
- **Ethereum (Chain ID: 101)**: Primary deployment with full feature set
- **Polygon (Chain ID: 109)**: Optimized for low-cost operations
- **Arbitrum (Chain ID: 110)**: Layer 2 efficiency focus
- **Optimism (Chain ID: 111)**: Rollup-based scaling
- **BNB Chain (Chain ID: 102)**: High throughput operations

### 2. Cross-Chain Price Oracle Integration

#### Chainlink Oracle Implementation
```solidity
interface IPriceOracle {
    function getBTCMinerPrice(uint16 chainId) external view returns (uint256);
    function getTHSBTCRate() external view returns (uint256);
    function getLatestRoundData() external view returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80);
}
```

**Oracle Requirements:**
- Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds on each supported chain
- Implement custom aggregation logic for cross-chain price synchronization
- Create fallback mechanisms using multiple oracle sources (Band Protocol, API3)
- Implement time-weighted average pricing (TWAP) for stability
- Set up automatic price update triggers with 1-minute intervals maximum

#### Custom Oracle Network Specifications
- Deploy decentralized oracle nodes on each chain
- Implement consensus mechanisms for price validation
- Create price deviation alerts (>2% variance triggers rebalancing)
- Establish backup oracle providers for redundancy

### 3. Cross-Chain Burn and Mint Router

#### Router Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract BTCMinerRouter {
    mapping(uint16 => address) public chainContracts;
    mapping(address => uint256) public burnAmounts;
    mapping(address => uint256) public mintedTHS;
    
    function crossChainBurn(uint256 amount, uint16 targetChain) external;
    function mintTHS(address recipient, uint256 amount) external;
    function calculateTHSAmount(uint256 btcMinerAmount) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

**Router Implementation Requirements:**
- Deploy unified router contracts on each chain
- Implement atomic cross-chain operations with rollback mechanisms
- Create real-time exchange rate calculations using oracle data
- Establish secure message passing between chains using LayerZero's messaging
- Implement slippage protection for large transactions (>$10,000 value)

#### Backend Infrastructure
- **Node.js/TypeScript backend** for cross-chain coordination
- Redis for caching cross-chain states and pending transactions
- PostgreSQL for transaction logging and analytics
- WebSocket connections for real-time price updates
- Implement queue systems for handling high-volume transactions

### 4. Liquidity Management System

#### Cross-Chain Liquidity Protocol Integration
```solidity
contract LiquidityManager {
    mapping(uint16 => uint256) public chainLiquidity;
    mapping(uint16 => bool) public liquidityWarnings;
    
    function rebalanceLiquidity(uint16 fromChain, uint16 toChain, uint256 amount) external;
    function checkLiquidityHealth() external view returns (bool);
}
```

**Liquidity Requirements:**
- Integrate with **LI.FI** and **Socket.tech** for cross-chain liquidity routing
- Implement automated rebalancing when chain liquidity drops below 20%
- Create liquidity provider incentive mechanisms (0.1% fee sharing)
- Set up emergency liquidity injection protocols

#### Arbitrage Incentive Structure
- Deploy arbitrage monitoring smart contracts
- Implement MEV-resistant pricing mechanisms
- Create arbitrage bot APIs with rate limiting
- Establish arbitrage opportunity alerts (>0.5% price difference)

### 5. Security and Auditing Framework

#### Smart Contract Security Requirements
- **Mandatory audits** by minimum 2 tier-1 firms (Certik, ConsenSys Diligence, Trail of Bits)
- Implement comprehensive test coverage (>95% line coverage)
- Deploy contracts with upgradeable proxy patterns (OpenZeppelin)
- Implement multi-signature wallets for admin functions (3-of-5 configuration)
- Set up automated security monitoring with Forta or similar tools

#### Security Measures Implementation
```solidity
contract SecurityModule {
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedCallers;
    uint256 public maxDailyBurn = 1000000 * 10**18; // 1M tokens
    uint256 public dailyBurnCounter;
    uint256 public lastResetTime;
    
    modifier onlyAuthorized() {
        require(authorizedCallers[msg.sender], "Unauthorized");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier dailyLimitCheck(uint256 amount) {
        if (block.timestamp >= lastResetTime + 24 hours) {
            dailyBurnCounter = 0;
            lastResetTime = block.timestamp;
        }
        require(dailyBurnCounter + amount <= maxDailyBurn, "Daily limit exceeded");
        _;
    }
}
```
