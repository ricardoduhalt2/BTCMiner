# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BTCMiner is an advanced omnichain fungible token (OFT) that leverages LayerZero's infrastructure to enable seamless cross-chain operations with dynamic burn-to-mint mechanisms for $THS (Terahash) conversion. The system will provide users with the ability to transfer tokens across multiple blockchain networks while maintaining price synchronization and liquidity management through sophisticated oracle integration and automated rebalancing mechanisms.

## Requirements

1. WHEN price data is requested THEN the system SHALL integrate Chainlink Price Feeds on each supported chain
2. WHEN price synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL implement custom aggregation logic for cross-chain consistency
3. WHEN primary oracles fail THEN the system SHALL use fallback mechanisms with Band Protocol and API3
4. WHEN price updates occur THEN the system SHALL implement time-weighted average pricing (TWAP) for stability
5. WHEN price data is stale THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic updates with maximum 1-minute intervals
6. WHEN price deviation exceeds 2% THEN the system SHALL trigger rebalancing alerts

### Requirement 3: Cross-Chain Burn and Mint Operations

**User Story:** As a BTCMiner token holder, I want to burn my tokens on one chain and mint equivalent $THS tokens on another chain, so that I can optimize my holdings across different networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a burn operation is initiated THEN the system SHALL deploy unified router contracts on each chain
2. WHEN cross-chain operations execute THEN the system SHALL implement atomic operations with rollback mechanisms
3. WHEN exchange rates are calculated THEN the system SHALL use real-time oracle data for accurate conversions
4. WHEN cross-chain messages are sent THEN the system SHALL use LayerZero's secure messaging protocol
5. WHEN large transactions (>$10,000) are processed THEN the system SHALL implement slippage protection
6. WHEN daily burn limits are reached THEN the system SHALL enforce maximum 1M token daily burn limit

### Requirement 4: Liquidity Management and Rebalancing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated liquidity management across chains, so that users always have sufficient liquidity for their transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN liquidity drops below 20% on any chain THEN the system SHALL trigger automated rebalancing
2. WHEN liquidity providers participate THEN the system SHALL distribute 0.1% fee sharing rewards
3. WHEN emergency liquidity is needed THEN the system SHALL execute injection protocols
4. WHEN arbitrage opportunities exceed 0.5% price difference THEN the system SHALL send alerts
5. WHEN rebalancing occurs THEN the system SHALL integrate with LI.FI and Socket.tech for routing
6. WHEN liquidity health is checked THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status across all chains

### Requirement 5: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a token holder, I want my assets to be secure from attacks and unauthorized access, so that I can trust the system with my investments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contracts are deployed THEN the system SHALL complete audits by minimum 2 tier-1 security firms
2. WHEN code coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve >95% line coverage in tests
3. WHEN admin functions are called THEN the system SHALL require 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet approval
4. WHEN upgrades are proposed THEN the system SHALL enforce 48-hour time-locked upgrades
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block non-authorized callers
6. WHEN security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger automated monitoring alerts

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive dashboard to manage my cross-chain tokens, so that I can easily perform transactions and monitor my portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the platform THEN the system SHALL provide a React.js/Next.js frontend with TypeScript
2. WHEN wallet connections are made THEN the system SHALL support WalletConnect and MetaMask integration
3. WHEN price data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show real-time updates via WebSocket connections
4. WHEN users check balances THEN the system SHALL aggregate wallet balances across all chains
5. WHEN transaction history is requested THEN the system SHALL display records across all supported chains
6. WHEN gas optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide cost-saving suggestions

### Requirement 7: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and high performance metrics, so that I can ensure optimal system operation and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-chain transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL achieve >99.5% success rate
2. WHEN cross-chain transfers occur THEN the system SHALL complete them in <5 minutes average time
3. WHEN price synchronization happens THEN the system SHALL maintain <0.1% deviation accuracy
4. WHEN system uptime is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve >99.9% availability
5. WHEN gas costs are compared THEN the system SHALL use <50% of standard ERC-20 transfer costs
6. WHEN monitoring alerts trigger THEN the system SHALL notify operators via PagerDuty for critical issues

### Requirement 8: ICP Digital Identity Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use Internet Identity for secure authentication and wallet linking across all chains, so that I can have a unified identity experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use Internet Identity for user authentication
